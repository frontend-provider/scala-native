Language semantics
==================

In general, the semantics of the Scala Native language are the same as Scala on
the JVM. However, a few differences exist, which we mention here.

Interop extensions
------------------

Annotations and types defined ``scala.scalanative.native`` may modify semantics
of the language for sake of interoperability with C libraries, read more about
those in :ref:`interop` section.

Multithreading
--------------

Scala Native doesn't yet provide libraries for parallel multi-threaded
programming and assumes single-threaded execution by default.

It's possible to use C libraries to get access to multi-threading and
synchronization primitives but this is not officially supported at the moment.

Finalization
------------

Finalize method from ``java.lang.Object`` is never called in Scala Native.

Undefined behavior
------------------

A number of error conditions which are well-defined on JVM are undefined
behavior:

1. Dereferencing null.
2. Division by zero.
3. Stack overflows.

Those typically crash application with a segfault on the supported architectures.
